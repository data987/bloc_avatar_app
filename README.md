## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `flutter pub get` for getting all the packages
3. Launch the app running `flutter run`, you have to open a simulator first, and I recommend you to start the app from **Visual Studio Code** :rocket:
